 * A lightweight youtube embed. Still should feel the same to the user, just MUCH faster to initialize and paint.

     *   preload/prefetch'ing them outside the iframe will only cause double-downloads.
     * So, the best we can do is warm up a few connections to origins that are in the critical path.
     *
     * Maybe `<link rel=preload as=document>` would work, but it's unsupported: http://crbug.com/593267
     * But TBH, I don't think it'll happen soon with Site Isolation and split caches adding serious complexity.
